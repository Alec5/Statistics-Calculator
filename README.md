# Statistics-Calculator
Calculate the mean, median, mode, mean absolute deviation, minimum, and maximum values of a data set.

This program will calculate numerous statistics about a dataset. The values are accuarte, but be sure to input the numbers in the proper way. Separate each number in the set by one space. No commas or punctuation, only spaces. Do not type any extra spaces at the beginning or end of the dataset. If you type more than one space between each number, it can mess up the number input in the program, and this will cause the output to be inaccurate.
